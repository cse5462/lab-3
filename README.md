## TicTacToe Player 1
> By: Conner Graham

### DESCRIPTION <a name="description-p1"></a>
This lab contains a program called "tictactoeP1" which TODO.
The specific tasks the client performs are as follows:
- TODO

If the number of arguments is incorrect remote port is
invalid, the program prints appropriate messages and
shows how to correctly invoke the program. 

### USAGE <a name="usage-p1"></a>
Start the TicTacToe P1 Server with the command...
```sh
$ tictactoeP1 <local-port>
```

If any of the argument strings contain whitespace, those
arguments will need to be enclosed in quotes.

### ASSUMPTIONS <a name="assumptions-p1"></a>

## TicTacToe Player 2
> By: Ben Nagel

### DESCRIPTION <a name="description-p2"></a>
This lab contains a program called "tictactoeP2" which creates and sets up a byte transfer protocal client. This client connects to the specified server( IP address and port), reads in a byte from the server and sends a byte back. This process continues until a winner or a tie has been reached.

The specific tasks the client performs are as
follows:
- Create server socket from user provided IP/port
- Establish TCP STREAM connection to remote server
- Perform byte transfer over the connection
- Terminate the connection to the server

### USAGE <a name="usage-p2"></a>
Start the TicTacToe P2 Client with the command...
```sh
$ tictactoeP2 <remote-IP> <local-port>
```

If any of the argument strings contain whitespace, those
arguments will need to be enclosed in quotes.

### ASSUMPTIONS <a name="assumptions-p2"></a>
- Client send and recieves characters as 1 byte.
- The characters sent are ASCII 
- The spaces on the tictactoe board are 1-9
- Player 1 is the "server": they are the one who calls bind()   
- Player 1 goes first
- Player 2 is the "client": they are the one who calls connect() 
- On any errors, close the connection 
- It is assumed that the IP addresses 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255 are invalid remote server addresses to connect to as they are reserved values.
